isin_quotes is a Home Assistant custom component that fetches market quotes by ISIN from ING endpoints and exposes clean sensors for prices and metadata. It supports per-exchange/currency selection via a guided config flow, streams intraday data for live dashboards, and loads historical ranges for charting; optionally, you can enter trades to compute P&L and performance. This project is community-driven and unaffiliated with INGâ€”use responsibly and be mindful of API limits.
